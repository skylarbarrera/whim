  - Configuration options for different creation modes
  - Shared GeneratedSpec interface for consistent output

- [x] Task 5: Add comprehensive testing (Pre-existing)

- ✅ GitHub issues automatically trigger spec creation
- ✅ Both flows produce consistently formatted, validated specs
- ✅ System gracefully handles errors in both flows
- ✅ All new functionality covered by automated tests
- ✅ Documentation exists for both spec creation flows

## Bug Fix Phase - In Progress
- Phase 1.1: Fixed createPullRequest to check for unpushed commits instead of uncommitted changes
  - Function now properly detects commits ahead of origin using `git rev-list`
  - Skips commit step if Ralph already committed (no uncommitted changes)
  - Adds extensive logging with [PR] prefix for debugging
  - Falls back to multiple refs (origin/HEAD, origin/main, origin/master)
  - Forces push attempt for new branches not yet on remote
- Phase 1.2: Added structured error logging with step tracking
  - PRStep enum identifies each step (STAGE, COMMIT, CHECK_UNPUSHED, PUSH, CREATE_PR)
  - PRResult type with status (success/no_changes/error), step, prUrl, error details
  - logCommandFailure helper logs full command, exit code, stdout, stderr
  - Callers can distinguish "no changes" from actual errors
- Phase 1.3: Pass GH_TOKEN properly to gh command
  - Now passes both GH_TOKEN and GITHUB_TOKEN for maximum compatibility
  - Logs masked token presence (first 4 chars + length) for debugging
  - Preserves GH_HOST environment variable for GitHub Enterprise
  - Added setup.test.ts with token masking tests
- Phase 2: Add Test Infrastructure to Worker
  - Added jest, ts-jest, typescript, vitest to worker Dockerfile
  - Created testing.ts module with runTests() function
  - Added 17 tests for the testing module (hasTestScript, parseTestOutput, runTests)
  - Integrated test validation in index.ts after Ralph completes
  - Supports Jest, Vitest, and Bun test output parsing
  - 5-minute default timeout with graceful shutdown
- Phase 3.1: Wrap PR creation in try/catch
  - Wraps createPullRequest() call in try/catch for unexpected errors
  - Logs error message and stack trace on exception
  - Reports partial success (work done, PR failed) to orchestrator
  - Adds stdout/stderr logging for PRResult error cases
- Phase 3.2: Log full stderr/stdout from failed git/gh commands
  - Added logSetupCommandResult() helper for setup step failures
  - All git commands in setupWorkspace() now log full output on failure
  - git config, git add, git commit, git clone, git checkout all covered
  - ralph init logs full output on warning/failure
  - Git clone URL sanitized in logs (token masked)
- Phase 3.3: Add retry logic for transient network failures
  - Added execWithRetry() with exponential backoff + jitter
  - isRetryableError() detects: connection errors, 5xx HTTP, rate limiting
  - Default: 3 retries, 1s base delay, 10s max delay
  - Applied to git push and gh pr create commands
  - 6 new tests for isRetryableError (110 total tests)
- Phase 4.3: Track and report test execution results in worker metrics
  - Added testsFailed and testStatus to WorkerMetrics
  - Added testsFailed and testStatus to WorkerCompleteRequest
  - Updated RalphMetrics, index.ts, and orchestrator db.ts
  - Worker now reports complete test info to orchestrator
