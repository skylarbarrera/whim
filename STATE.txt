  - Docker images (orchestrator, intake) build successfully
  - docker-compose brings postgres, redis, orchestrator online and healthy
  - API endpoints verified: /health, /api/status, /api/work, /api/queue, /api/workers, /api/metrics
  - Issues documented in `.ai/new-learnings.md`
  - Fixed: bun lockfile issues, missing curl in docker, missing tsconfig.json, port conflicts

## All 10 Phases Complete
The AI Software Factory implementation is complete.

## Bug Fix Phase - In Progress
- Phase 1.1: Fixed createPullRequest to check for unpushed commits instead of uncommitted changes
  - Function now properly detects commits ahead of origin using `git rev-list`
  - Skips commit step if Ralph already committed (no uncommitted changes)
  - Adds extensive logging with [PR] prefix for debugging
  - Falls back to multiple refs (origin/HEAD, origin/main, origin/master)
  - Forces push attempt for new branches not yet on remote
- Phase 1.2: Added structured error logging with step tracking
  - PRStep enum identifies each step (STAGE, COMMIT, CHECK_UNPUSHED, PUSH, CREATE_PR)
  - PRResult type with status (success/no_changes/error), step, prUrl, error details
  - logCommandFailure helper logs full command, exit code, stdout, stderr
  - Callers can distinguish "no changes" from actual errors
- Phase 1.3: Pass GH_TOKEN properly to gh command
  - Now passes both GH_TOKEN and GITHUB_TOKEN for maximum compatibility
  - Logs masked token presence (first 4 chars + length) for debugging
  - Preserves GH_HOST environment variable for GitHub Enterprise
  - Added setup.test.ts with token masking tests
- Phase 2: Add Test Infrastructure to Worker
  - Added jest, ts-jest, typescript, vitest to worker Dockerfile
  - Created testing.ts module with runTests() function
  - Added 17 tests for the testing module (hasTestScript, parseTestOutput, runTests)
  - Integrated test validation in index.ts after Ralph completes
  - Supports Jest, Vitest, and Bun test output parsing
  - 5-minute default timeout with graceful shutdown
